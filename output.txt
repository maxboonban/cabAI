graduation your track appears your transcript and helps you communicate your particular expertise Both tracks share two required courses and have third required computer security course that explores similar content These required courses enable students both tracks build common foundation learn from each other and formulate shared framework for creating solutions Required courses cover from three perspectives computing management and law ' important note that our course offerings are curated and limited Students should not expect variety new courses frequently added substantial number course options each term This especially true for the Policy Track because does not benefit extensively the Computer Science Track from many the established courses the Computer Science Department since courses the Policy Track assume prior programming knowledge However our courses and curriculum are studied and assessed program leadership often ensure that our program reflects the most contemporary challenges facing The standard curriculum the Master Science degree designed for students completing the program full time two courses per semester offer the flexibility complete the program part time one course per semester well The program designed completed semesters takes courses complete the program and you can take courses per semester but strongly recommend taking courses per semester especially during your first term Brown not currently offer summer term courses the program courses would completed during fall and spring Please note that outside the two courses per semester program may affect the courses that are avaiable you and may prevent you from graduating your intended semester since the program offers limited courses and courses are offered different terms Students the

typically have one two goals they intend pursue research careers computer science and are preparing themselves enter PhD programs they intend become professional computer scientists and pursue careers industry both cases students should take collections courses that not only give them strength particular areas computer science but also include areas that familiarize them with other ways thinking about the field For example student whose interests are the practical aspects designing computer systems should certainly take courses this area but should also exposed the mindset theoretical computer science rapidly changing discipline there much cross among areas and students should have some experience doing advanced work areas not directly related their own Students whose goals are research careers should become involved quickly possible with research groups part their Master studies and demonstrate and learn about research The resulting research reports will serve establish their suitability for entering PhD programs Students whose goals are professional computer scientists should have some professional experience part their preparation certain amount basic coursework required before student can qualify for useful internship Students with limited experience computer science should take few advanced computer science courses before embarking internship Other students particularly those whose degrees were Brown will likely have had internship experiences while Internships provide insights for subsequent courses and project work Brown Students without such experiences are disadvantage with respect their peers Thus strongly encourage students who have not had such experience choose one options for which internships are required Note that these internships are not courses and the work not evaluated would for course Students advisors will assist them choosing internship but students themselves ensure that they get much benefit possible from their experiences They must able take advantage these experiences while completing their Master projects expect high quality work from them from students who entered the program with prior internship

graduate studies Master Getting this approval will require you show that the courses are relevant your interests general the more non courses you wish take the stronger your must Advanced Component The advanced component requires you complete one the following four course options Reading and Research courses may used options and advanced course used below 2000 level course Internships used below must approved the student advisor and are paid work the area the student Master studies and are explained further below The four options are Complete research project two instances CSCI 2980 supervised and approved your research advisor Complete research project two instances CSCI 2980 supervised and approved your research advisor and complete internship Complete two advanced courses not including CSCI 2980 Complete two advanced courses not including CSCI 2980 and complete internship Note that options and are known the professional track Rationale Students entering the Master program typically have one two goals they intend pursue research careers computer science and are preparing themselves enter PhD programs they intend become professional computer scientists and pursue careers industry both cases students should take collections courses that not only give them strength particular areas computer science but also include areas that familiarize them with other ways thinking about the field For example student whose interests are the practical aspects designing computer systems should certainly take courses this area but should also exposed the mindset theoretical computer science rapidly changing discipline there much cross among areas and students should have some experience doing advanced work areas not directly related their own Students whose goals are research careers should become involved quickly possible with research groups part their Master studies and demonstrate and learn about research The resulting research reports will serve establish their suitability for entering PhD programs Students whose goals are professional computer scientists should have some professional experience part their preparation certain amount basic coursework required before student can qualify for useful internship Students with limited experience computer science should take few advanced computer science courses before embarking internship Other students particularly those whose degrees were Brown will likely have had internship experiences while Internships provide insights for subsequent courses and project work Brown Students without such experiences are disadvantage with respect their peers Thus strongly encourage students who have not had such experience choose one options for which internships are required Note that these internships are not courses and the work not evaluated would for course Students advisors will assist them choosing internship but students themselves ensure that they get much benefit possible from their experiences They must able take advantage these experiences while completing their Master projects expect high quality work from them from students who entered the program with prior internship

experience that probably could not have been picked from course work the sort work you did over the summer something you would like continue doing once you graduate Explain Would you recommend your summer experience other Brown students Explain Computer Science Computer SciencePh Requirements Requirements for the program can found https brownedu degrees doctoral reqs reqs phd2015pdf The department Computer Science offers two graduate degrees computer science The Master Science degree for those who wish improve their professional competence computer science prepare for further graduate study and the Doctor Philosophy degree For more information admission please visit the following website http wwwbrownedu academics gradschool programs computer science Requirements for the Masters Degree The requirements for Master Science ScM degree Computer Science consist basic component and advanced component All courses must the 1000 level higher Students must have average over all courses used satisfy the requirements All courses must taken for grade and all grades must better ' may not used The courses your program must approved the Director Graduate Studies Master well your advisor Basic Component The basic component consists six courses None these courses may reading and research courses such CSCI 2980 The six courses are chosen follows Two must courses that form pathway see the explanation pathways https brownedu degrees undergrad requirements 2020 pathways for and masters students One must course area that not listed the chosen pathway must not core course must not grad course and must not related course the pathway must also not course taken another institution The three additional courses must related and must approved your advisor the director graduate studies Master Getting this approval will require you show that the courses are relevant your interests general the more non courses you wish take the stronger your must Advanced Component The advanced component requires you complete one the following four course options Reading and Research courses may used options and advanced course used below 2000 level course Internships used below must approved the student advisor and are paid work the area the student Master studies and are explained further below The four options are Complete research project two instances CSCI 2980 supervised and approved your research advisor Complete research project two instances CSCI 2980 supervised and approved your research advisor and complete internship Complete two advanced courses not including CSCI 2980 Complete two advanced courses not including CSCI 2980 and complete internship Note that options and are known the professional track Rationale Students entering the Master program typically have one two goals they intend pursue research careers computer science and are preparing themselves enter PhD programs they intend become professional computer scientists and pursue careers industry both cases students should take collections courses that not only give them strength particular areas computer science but also include areas that familiarize them with other ways thinking about the field For example student whose interests are the practical aspects designing computer systems should certainly take courses this area but should also exposed the mindset theoretical computer science rapidly changing discipline there much cross among areas and students should have some experience doing advanced work areas not directly related their own Students whose goals are research careers should become involved quickly possible with research groups part their Master studies and demonstrate and learn about research The resulting research reports will serve establish their suitability for entering PhD programs Students whose goals are professional computer scientists should have some professional experience part their preparation certain amount basic coursework required before student can qualify for useful internship Students with limited experience computer science should take few advanced computer science courses before embarking internship Other students particularly those whose degrees were Brown will likely have had internship experiences while Internships provide insights for subsequent courses and project work Brown Students without such experiences are disadvantage with respect their peers Thus strongly encourage students who have not had such experience choose one options for which internships are required Note that these internships are not courses and the work not evaluated would for course Students advisors will assist them choosing internship but students themselves ensure that they get much benefit possible from their experiences They must able take advantage these experiences while completing their Master projects expect high quality work from them from students who entered the program with prior internship experiences Master' degree normally requires three four semesters full time study depending upon one' preparation CSCI 1010Theory Computation1 CSCI 1040The Basics Systems1 CSCI Computer Graphics CSCI

one one and remote office hours Information What' this course about CS1660 formerly called CS166 course computer systems security through balanced mixture theory and practice start out with building the foundations security through exploration cryptography From there move more complex multi faceted systems such web applications operating systems and networks Along the way explore topics such physical security social engineering privacy anonymity usability and the security emergent systems such blockchains and machine learning learning about security through these multiple domains you concretely learn how various classes attacks appear vast variety scenarios and how they work practice You also learn how evaluate systems from writing precise security analyses about subtle issues protocols discovering and exploiting concrete technical systems for yourself Through all these activities you ultimately work develop specific kind intuition security mindset that will give you the knowledge vocabulary and confidence critically analyze and effectively defend the software and systems you approach computer scientist even after the course CS1620 CS2660 The Lab encourage you take additional half credit lab called CS1620 for CS2660 for master graduate students concurrent master students Senior may use the lab portion count for their capstone requirement Students taking the lab have the opportunity work advanced challenges that will provide you with greater appreciation systems security and the security mindset whole CS1620 CS2660 provides students with deeper the material doing advanced versions the CS1660 projects and advanced questions the written assignments These advanced versions focus real world skills performing attacks that are more difficult and rely less serious performing attacks against systems with more real world constraints and creating attacks that achieve higher standard quality than mere proof concept CS1620 CS2660 Due credit counting logistics the lab portion the course has two different course numbers CS1620 and CS2660 students wishing the half credit lab should sign for CS1620 addition CS1660 CS2660 combines both CS1660 and CS1620 one 2000 level course you are graduate student ScB student who has applied for the concurrent master' program and wish earn 2000 level credit for this course you should sign for CS2660 only What the difference Both CS1620 and CS2660 share the same extra course content but only CS2660 counts for 2000 level credit course materials will refer the lab portion simply CS1620 this includes both CS1620 and CS2660 students How much work the lab previous years students taking the lab report spending extra hours each project throughout the semester though they also note that the additional components are more front loaded the second half the semester much more flexible anticipate that this will the same this year You not need any additional experience beyond the base prerequsites the course succeed with the lab anyone who feels comfortable taking CS1660 should also feel comfortable taking CS1620 CS2660 long you are comfortable with the extra time requirement Note that students taking CS2660 are committed completing the requirements for both the lab and main portion the course after the add drop period ends not possible for CS2660 student drop the lab portion and still get credit for CS1660 the same semester How sign you are interested the lab portion should register for CS1660 and CS1620 CAB Senior are eligible capstone with CS1620 email the HTA list you intend have

you already responded and need edit your response you can clicking the form link again What are chances hope admit around 100 students across all sections CS1660 and CS2660 While cannot officially guarantee that all students the waitlist will able take the course have typically been able accommodate all students the end shopping period You should have intro sequence worth programming experience 0160 0180 0190 and have good systems programming 0300 0330 1310 1330 This concretely means that You should comfortable writing programs and scripts language your choice such Python Ruby Bash etc somewhat comfortable Unix command line environment running binaries filesystem navigation etc and have basic systems programming concepts such memory management and networking You also should have heard the terms race condition packet TCP UDP buffer overflows and DNS you forget what these are don worry describe them again when they come the latter half the course You should also willing learn how read code languages that you never used before will gain practice with this throughout the course learn about securing systems many areas you don meet the official but still want take the course please consult the instructors during shopping period are happy discuss your individual situation determine the course right for you Your willingness challenge yourself perhaps the most important prerequsite for the course Security can frustrating times but the rewards are great exchange for engaging with some difficult intellectual challenges you have the opportunity gain concrete insights

completely different things all them you haven taken any them great CS1660 great introduction the field and you learn lot through this course you have taken subset these courses also great lot CS1660 material will still new you and all these courses are useful terms honing your security mindset for the long term 1510 focuses cryptography from theoretical and more formal perspective building the concepts learned 1010 and involves proving that are secure under defined precise notions security comparison 1660 looks small slice applied cryptography and generally assume the tools that using are secure instead focus the practical applications conventional cryptography applies computer systems 1650 deep dive into software security which focuses low level memory the stack and coursework primarily focuses developing attacks comparison 1660 looks higher level abstractions cryptography browser and web applications networks etc and principles systems security Our coursework also focuses mix discovering attacks and designing defenses don really look software security stack based code execution all 1800 looks from more historical and policy driven perspective comparison 1660 motivates much its content with historical examples but primarily about technical details 2390 about privacy engineering making sure that the data either not collected the first place collected not misused comparison 1660 focuses the whole the CIA mnemonic integrity and availability some the techniques used privacy engineering overlap with 1660 content but our usage and analysis those techniques differs Can use this course ugrad capstone you 7th semester greater then you can use CS1660 capstone completing the lab this you must register for CS1620 CS2660 and you need email the HTA list indicate that

present along with the instructor research papers their peers will begin with summary prevalent software and hardware related defects which are typically found applications written memory unsafe languages like and contemporary such x86 and ARM and proceed surveying what are against traditional and modern exploitation techniques ranging from classical code injection and code reuse the newest goodies like JIT ROP Blind ROP and software based attacks For the bulk part will focusing the latest advances protection mechanisms mitigation techniques and tools against modern classes and exploitation methods syllabuspdf CSCI 1650 Software Security and Exploitation CSCI 1670 Operating Systems Course Format Every week will discussing set research papers Students are expected read the assigned papers and write short review critique before each class addition one more student will short presentation about each paper for the day which will the starting point for our discussion parallel students will work semester long project open research problem related the topics covered the course Projects can have offensive defensive focus both while projects relating the students' own research interests are strongly encouraged provided they also fit with the theme the class Paper Reviews Everyone apart from the presenter expected read the assigned reading for the week and submit constructive critique review The reviews should most page long provide summary the assigned paper discuss the pros and cons the proposed idea protection mechanism bypass technique and conclude with least two thought provoking questions regarding the material covered along with brief direction future work Paper Each student will presenting set research paper the class and evaluated the following Does the presenter understand the material Does the presented have insights and opinions beyond what the paper Clarity Can the audience understand the presentation Are there useful examples Materials the slides use whiteboard illustrate and support the talk Are there diagrams help convey the Delivery Has the presenter practiced Non regurgiation Did the presenter something beyond simply typing sections the paper bullet points Did the presenter motivate the ideas their own words Answering questions Can the presenter handle questions from the audience Course Project The semester long course project entails working open research problem which can defensive offensive nature both and submitting the instructor workshop quality research paper Note that although the project may rely concepts learned from existing papers must also introduce new ideas Validation prior work terms and performance permitted but such cases more thorough analysis the original work' strengths and weaknesses must undertaken Grading Paper reviews Paper Discussion Project report Project presentation Policy You are free discuss technical issues regarding the assigned readings your project with your peers You may also consult outside sources information for your project and presentation but you must cite them Every write paper review project report code presentation must entirely your own work Academic Code
