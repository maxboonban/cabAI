Description: Many applications, across industries varying from ecommerce to education, rely on data processing and machine learning systems for data analytics tasks. Deep learning techniques are now being applied to problems such as search, coding assistants, and chip placement. Due to how widely used these applications are, performance, specifically latency, throughput, and hardware efficiency, is very important. However, achieving high performance in these systems can be challenging. ML systems are run on different types of hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) that have unique performance characteristics. Models are becoming larger and larger, and even with access to the most powerful hardware, systems must manage memory bandwidth and network bandwidth carefully when doing training and inference. Additionally, organizations deploying these large-scale ML systems tend to worry about more than just performance: they must worry about other factors such as energy usage, debuggability, and easy

This class focuses on the extent to which we can understand and control such models, as well as review evidence that neural networks learn interpretable processes in their weights without direct supervision to do so. There will be an emphasis on interpretability of language models (LMs), although interpretability of vision models will also be touched upon when relevant. Topics covered will include causal interventions, probing, input attribution methods, and more recent topics in mechanistic interpretability. History and motivations for studying interpretability will also be discussed.

Description: Prepares graduate students with the knowledge they need to apply Deep Learning techniques for their own research. There has been tremendous success in developing unified neural architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance on language understanding (GPT-3), visual perception (ViT), and even protein structure prediction (AlphaFold). We plan to understand how they work, and how the success of such unified models can give rise to further developments on self-supervised learning, a technique that trains machine learning models without requiring labeled data; and multimodal learning, a technique that utilizes multiple input sources, such as vision, audio, and text. We will study recent attempts to interpret these models, thus revealing potential risks on model bias. Paper reading, student presentations, and invited guest lectures. Students required to work on a final project that explores a novel direction along the line of the papers we cover.
